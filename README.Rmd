## Package status

`tibbletime` has been officially retired. We will continue to maintain but not be adding new functionality. Options to get new functionality:

- [__timetk__](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/index.html) - Provides time series visualization, wrangling, and preprocessing using `tibble` structure
- [__tsibble__](https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble) - Provides wrangling using `tsibble` structure

## A time aware tibble

Built on top of the `tidyverse`, `tibbletime` is an extension
that allows for the creation of _time aware tibbles_ through the setting of 
a time index. 

Some immediate advantages of this include: 

1) Performing compact time-based subsetting on tibbles.

2) Partitioning an index column by time (like
yearly, monthly, every 2 weeks, etc.) so that you can use `dplyr`'s grouped
functionality to summarise and aggregate by time period.

3) Changing the periodicity of a time-based tibble. This allows easily changing 
from a daily dataset to a monthly or yearly dataset.

4) Easily working with the pipe and packages like `dplyr` and `tidyr` to make for a 
seamless experience with time series and the tidyverse. Each function has also 
been designed to work with `dplyr::group_by()` allowing for powerful data manipulation.

5) Modifying functions for rolling analysis.

6) Creating `tbl_time` time series objects quickly.

7) Using fully supported `Date` and `POSIXct` index columns, along with experimental 
support for `yearmon`, `yearqtr` and `hms` which should become more stable
as some issues in `dplyr` are worked out.

## Installation

Development Version:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("business-science/tibbletime")
```

CRAN Version: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tibbletime")
```

## Major update warning

If you have been using `0.0.2`, the update to `0.1.0` has introduced 
major breaking changes. This was necessary for long term stability of the package,
and no attempt to support backwards compatability was made at this early 
stage in development. We apologize for any issues this causes.
See NEWS for complete details.

## Getting started

The first thing to do is to turn your `tibble` into a `tbl_time` object.
Notice the specification of the `index` as the `date` column of `FB`.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tibbletime)
library(dplyr)

# Facebook stock prices. Comes with the package
data(FB)

# Convert FB to tbl_time
FB <- as_tbl_time(FB, index = date)

FB
```

There are a number of functions that were designed specifically for `tbl_time`
objects. Some of them are:

1) `filter_time()` - Succinctly filter a tbl_time object by date.

2) `as_period()` - Convert a tbl_time object from daily to monthly, 
from minute data to hourly, and more. This allows the user to easily 
aggregate data to a less granular level.

3) `collapse_by()` - Take an `tbl_time` object, and collapse the index so that all
observations in an interval share the same date. The most common use of this
is to then group on this column with `dplyr::group_by()` and perform 
time-based calculations with `summarise()`, `mutate()` or any other `dplyr`
function.

3) `collapse_index()` - A lower level version of `collapse_by()` that directly
modifies the `index` column and not the entire `tbl_time` object. It allows the
user more flexibility when collapsing, like the ability to assign the resulting
collapsed index to a new column.

5) `rollify()` - Modify a function so that it calculates a value 
(or a set of values) at specific time intervals. This can be used for rolling
averages and other rolling calculations inside the `tidyverse` framework.

6) `create_series()` - Use shorthand notation to quickly 
initialize a `tbl_time` object containing a regularly spaced index column 
of class `Date`, `POSIXct`, `yearmon`, `yearqtr` or `hms`.

To look at just a few:

```{r}
# Filter for dates from March 2013 to December 2015
FB %>% 
  filter_time('2013-03' ~ '2015')

# Change from daily to monthly periodicity
# This just reduces the tibble to the last row in each month
FB %>% 
  as_period("monthly", side = "end")

# Maybe you don't want to lose the rest of the month's information,
# and instead you'd like to take the average of every column for each month
FB %>%
  select(-symbol) %>%
  collapse_by("monthly") %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise_all(mean)

# Perform a 5 period rolling average
mean_5 <- rollify(mean, window = 5)
mutate(FB, roll_mean = mean_5(adjusted))

# Create a time series
# Every other day in 2013
create_series(~'2013', '2 day')
```

## Grouping

Groups created through `dplyr::group_by()` are supported throughout the package.
Because `collapse_index()` is just adding a column you can group on, all
`dplyr` functions are supported.

```{r}
# Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google stocks
data(FANG)

# Summarise by period and by group
FANG %>% 
  as_tbl_time(date) %>%
  group_by(symbol) %>%
  
  # Collapse to yearly
  collapse_by("year") %>%
  
  # Additionally group by date (yearly)
  group_by(symbol, date) %>%
  
  # Perform a yearly summary for each symbol
  summarise(
    adj_min   = min(adjusted),
    adj_max   = max(adjusted),
    adj_range = adj_max - adj_min
  )
```

## Index order

`tibbletime` assumes that your dates are in _ascending order_. A warning will
be generated if they are not when you use a function where order is relevant. We do
this for speed purposes and to not force a change on the user's dataset by sorting
for them.
